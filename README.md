Image classifier using python
This python code helped me understand Image Classifier as a beginner and train images and make predictions. 
This code is prepared by Pranoy Radhakrishnan.

Keras doesn’t have STL10 inbuilt, hence I extracted the files manually using python code. Downsized the data from 8000 images to 4000 images as 10 classes. 

Open the folder load_data.py and STL10 to extract and load the data.

After prepared the dataset - run the code $python train.py

After training its time to test - run the code$python predict.py
