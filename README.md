Image classifier using python
This python code helped me understand Image Classifier as a beginner and train images and make predictions. 
This code is prepared by Pranoy Radhakrishnan
Keras doesnâ€™t have STL10 inbuilt, hence I extracted the files manually using python code. Downsized the data from 80000 images to 40000 images as 10 classes, each class has 4000 images in it. 
Open the folder load_data.py and STL10 to extract and load the data.
After prepared the dataset - run the code $python train.py
After training its time to test - run the code$python predict.py
